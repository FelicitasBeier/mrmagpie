#' @title calcNonLocalProduction
#' @description Calculates grid-level amount of food that would need to be transported,
#' assuming that food produced in the grid cell is first consumed by local population
#' i.e. amount of food greater than local rural demand, split into that which feeds the local
#' urban population, and that which exceeds total local demand and is available to export
#' @param cells magpiecell or lpjcell (default)
