\usage{
calcClusterHierarchical(
  regionscode,
  ncluster,
  lpjml = c(natveg = "LPJmL4", crop = "LPJmL5"),
  clusterdata = "yield_airrig",
  mode = "h",
  weight = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{regionscode}{regionscode of the regional mapping to be used.
Must agree with the regionscode of the mapping mentioned
in the madrat config!
Can be retrieved via \code{regionscode()}.}

\item{ncluster}{The desired total number of clusters.}

\item{lpjml}{defines LPJmL version for crop/grass and natveg specific inputs}

\item{clusterdata}{similarity data to be used to determine clusters:
yield_airrig (current default) or yield_increment}

\item{mode}{Clustering type. At the moment you can choose between
complete linkage clustering (h),
single linkage clustering (s) and
Ward clustering (w).}

\item{weight}{named vector with weighting factors for each region for the
cluster distribution, e.g. weight=c(AFR=3,EUR=0.5).
weight > 1 will grant more cluster to a region and
weight < 1 less cluster than by default.}
}
\value{
A mapping between regions and clusters
}
\description{
Performs MAgPIE hierarchical clustering and calculates corresponding spam
             relation matrix

As the creation of a clustering tree is very time consuming the function
checks first in the input folder if the corresponding data already exists
and if not it stores the tree information in the input folder for later use
in the next execution of this function.
